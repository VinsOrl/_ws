# About homework

Assignments are completed independently using html, CSS and Javascript
At the beginning, create a function to get the current time, store the time of entering the web page in the open variable, and add open to the post dictionary, so that the time the web page is opened is the creation time of the first two default posts.
For the post created later, you can use the time function left by the teacher at the end of the code to get the time. When the user presses the create button, the creation time of the post can be obtained.
